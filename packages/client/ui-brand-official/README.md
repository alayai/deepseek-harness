## Summary

This package gives every client build the ETRX mark and name in the sidebar and uses the same mark in the conversation hero. Choose it for deployments branded as ETRX; deployments with another identity should leave it out and provide a replacement brand package. It has no runtime state and does not affect model requests.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin in the browser roster of an ETRX deployment. Its occupants register independently of the selected client build profile.

### Build profiles

`DSH_CLIENT_BUILD_PROFILE` does not gate this package. Once mounted, every build profile receives the ETRX sidebar mark, sidebar name, and conversation-hero mark. The shell fallbacks render only when the composition leaves this package out or its slot declarations are unavailable. `DSH_CLIENT_TITLE` selects the browser title independently.

### Replacing the brand

A deployment with another identity leaves this package out and composes a replacement that occupies `sidebar.brand.mark`, `sidebar.brand.name`, and `conversation.hero.brand.mark`. Occupying these slots is the only composition route; there is no brand configuration surface here.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The three occupants install as one declaration-aware registration set: nested `ctx.slots.inject()` calls wait on all three declarations, so the set works whether this row activates before or after the declarers, withdraws every occupant when a declaration collapses, and leaves no partial brand mix during HMR. The browser half is [`src/client/index.ts`](src/client/index.ts); the node half is an empty Loader seat. The browser title is a build-environment concern (`DSH_CLIENT_TITLE`), outside the slot system.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the brand surface is not enough. They move from the slots this package occupies to the shell that renders them.

- [ui-sidebar](../ui-sidebar/README.md) — declares `sidebar.brand.mark` and `sidebar.brand.name` and renders their fallbacks.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares `conversation.hero.brand.mark` in the hero.
- [Web client architecture](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.md) — how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as the package contributes browser presentation only; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define how brand presentation is supplied. They are current package constraints, not a brand-design comparison or a task backlog.

- **One occupant set** — alternative presentation belongs in another Cordis package occupying the same slots.
- **The browser title is independent** — `DSH_CLIENT_TITLE` selects title text at build time rather than through a UI slot.

### Dev Note

<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

None.

</details>

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The package retains no mutable state, and its three slot occupants install and leave through one transactional effect.
